# Contributing to Blue Forest open-source projects

## Issues

If you experience any trouble running our source codes, please post an issue on the concerned GitHub repository and we will do our best to process it :
- [kiwi-bundle](https://github.com/kiwi-bundle/dropin/issues/new)

## Development

We have not yet established an external development protocol outside Blue Forest but we are open to your participation. Please feel free to contact us at contact@blueforest.cc.

As soon as necessary, we will set up a procedure and a best practices guide in this repository to allow any developer to contribute to our codebase.

Thank you for your interest !

### Workflow

We use the following tools on GitHub :
- **Issues** to reference and process bugs
- **Pull Requests** to release new versions
- **Discussions** to exchange with us and answer your questions
- **Actions** to manage our tests and deployments

The development of drop'in features is divided into seasons and episodes set up as Milestones on GitHub. The attribution of an Issue or a Pull Request to a Milestone is considered to be scheduled to an upcoming implementation.

There are two main branches :
- **main** : contains the most stable version of the code
- **develop** : contains the code with all the latest updates

### Files license header

In most of the repositories concerned, you will find a script (`./etc/init.sh`) that will automatically add a Git hook to insert the license header at the beginning of new source files.
