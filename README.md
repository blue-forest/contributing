# Contributing to Blue Forest open-source projects

## Issues

If you experience any trouble running our source codes, please post an issue on the concerned GitHub repository and we will do our best to process it :
- [dropin-compiler](https://github.com/theblueforest/dropin-compiler/issues/new)
- [wasm-ir](https://github.com/theblueforest/wasm-ir/issues/new)

## Development

We have not yet established an external development protocol outside Blue Forest but we are open to your participation. Please feel free to contact us at contact@blueforest.cc.

As soon as necessary, we will set up a procedure and a best practices guide in this repository to allow any developer to contribute to our codebase.

Thank you for your interest !

### Files license header

In most of the repositories concerned, you will find a `./etc/init.sh` script that will automatically add a Git hook to insert the license header at the beginning of new source files.
