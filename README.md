## Development

We have not yet established an external development protocol outside Blue Forest but we are open to your participation. Please feel free to contact us at contact@blueforest.cc.

As soon as necessary, we will set up a procedure and a best practices guide in this document to allow any developer to contribute to our code.

Thank you for your interest !

### Files license header

In most of the repositories concerned, you will find a `./etc/init.sh` script that will automatically add a Git hook to insert the license header at the beginning of new source files.
